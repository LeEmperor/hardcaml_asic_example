# PT8 memory adapter

`Variant_memory.project` binds one checked hardware assignment through
`Project.of_variant` to construction. The same constructor registers the actual
`program` RAM in the core and byte-wide TT adapter. Width is 16, read latency 1,
and supported depths are 128 and 256. The 128-word core intentionally decodes the
low seven address bits: address128 aliases address0. The 256-word core decodes all
eight bits. The public port remains eight bits for both so the boundary test can
distinguish them without trusting the declaration.

Resource requirement is a separate argument: explicit Flops, or Exact (only the
stock 256x16 macro is supported). There is no fallback. Existing
`asic/flow_catalog.ml` and `asic/flow_profiles.ml` supply backend settings; profile
changes do not add hardware parameters or create another launcher system.

The explicitly named ignored-depth negative consumes a valid checked assignment
and constructs depth256 regardless. Its valid hashes are expected to pass the
provider's integrity checks and fail this adapter's semantic conformance oracle.
It is never a supported variant.

No synthesis, place-and-route, STA, PDK probing, Workbench or daemon is needed.
The comparison subcommand calls the installed public comparison API directly.
Source inventories are observations, not compiled-source/P6 attestation.
